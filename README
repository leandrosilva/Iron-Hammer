It consists (or at least it will, when done) of three main components: an Anvil, a Hammer, and a Blacksmith.

== Anvil ==
Parse the contents of a directory, loading information about projects and solutions contained there

== Hammer ==
Provides command lines for building and running tests

== Blacksmith ==
The "intelligent" part of the mix, provides a DSL for utilizing the tools described above.

--- 
I might add more components to the mix if deemed necessary, like something to take care of the deployment process
